<h1>BREDO! The Better Credo (website)</h1>
<h4>yup, thats correct. im directly challenging our school/college's tech staff</h4>
<br>
Soo, what and why? Well:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Our original School website is really bland</li>
  <li>Also, its quite difficult to navigate huh. like bro why title the dashboard dashboard when there aint nothing else there.</li>
  <li>Color scheme. Login page: 😍, Dashboard and the rest: 🥴.</li>
  <li>No chat room? How do you expect children to learn? (mine also doesnt have one FOR NOW)</li>
  <li>Most importanty: This is made by a student. Come on now, which student has made a better school website for their school for free? huh?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
Although this aint the final product, was hoping to meet some other mofos to help me on this. So far, its a one-man army. Guess it should be expected, they just dont teach enough actual useful knowledge in Credo huh 😋. Btw im self learned.

If you got any complaints, dont say shi. Just keep em to yourself. I aint hearin non of that.
<br>
Thank you for reading. And please do enjoy this. I poured my heart and soul over this
<br>
PS: if you think this is so shitty nigga this crap is being developed by a 16 year old immature anime loving Valorant grinding guy. Its to be expected

<h4>By the way here's a roadmap. I wanna add all this into this amazing website (I cant even finish the main dashboard)</h4>
<p>❌ means not started. 🚧 means working on it. ✅ means up and running. ⏳ means i give up this is way too hard</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dashboard with nice UI</li>  🚧
  <li>Show basic student info</li>  🚧
  <li>Show student faculty and subjects info</li>  🚧
  <li>Show student exam reports</li>  ❌
  <li>Show student attendence info</li>  ❌
  <li>Add a chat page similiar to 4chan, called credoSan</li>  ❌
</ul>
If youve got anything that you think should be here let me know.
(Also know that i literally cant find any free hosting platform so maybe this wont workout after all still would be a lovely resume project)
