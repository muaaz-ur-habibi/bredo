<h1>BREDO! The Better Credo(website)</h1>
<h2>yup, thats correct. im directly challenging our school/college's tech staff's programming skills</h2>
<br>
Soo, what and why? Well:
<ul>
  <li>Our original School website is really bland</li>
  <li>Also, its quite difficult to navigate huh. like bro why title the dashboard dashboard when there aint nothing else there.</li>
  <li>Color scheme. Login page: üòç, Dashboard and the rest: ü•¥.</li>
  <li>No chat room? How do you expect children to learn? (mine also doesnt have one FOR NOW)</li>
  <li>Most importanty: This is made by a student. Come on now, which student has made a better school website for their school for free? huh?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Although this aint the final product, was hoping to meet some other mofos to help me on this. So far, its a one-man army. Guess it should be expected, they just dont teach enough Python in Credo College huh üòã. Btw im self learned.
If you got any complaints, dont say shi. Just keep em to yourself. I aint hearin non of that.

Thank you for reading. And please do enjoy this. I poured my heart and soul over this
<br>
PS: if you think this is so childish nigga this crap is being developed by a 16 year old immature anime loving Valorant grinding guy. Its to be expected
