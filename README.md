<h1>BREDO! The Better Credo (website)</h1>
<h4>yup, thats correct. im directly challenging our school/college's tech staff</h4>
<h5>Developed by a student of Credo School, and no they did not teach me this. I learned all of this myself</h5>
<h3>Soo, what and why? Well:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Our original School website is really bland</li>
  <li>Also, its quite difficult to navigate huh. like bro why title the dashboard dashboard when there aint nothing else there.</li>
  <li>Color scheme. Login page: 😍, Dashboard and the rest: 🥴.</li>
  <li>Most importanty: This is made by a student. Come on now, which student has made a better school website for their school for free? huh?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Frameworks and languages used to make this:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Flask - Python</li>
  <li>Requests - Python</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup4 - Python</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Bootstrap CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<h3>How does all the stuff in views.py work? (that's the main program)</h3>
<p>
  A basic and surface level run-down, the signin route uses Python Requests send a post request to the school's login page, once logged in it uses a session to stay connected, then it scrapes all the necessary data using BeautifulSoup4, and all the data that IS scrapable, sends it to the main dashboard route, where the data is refined, processed and cleaned, then sends to the HTML templates which use Jinja to display the data. CSS is used to beutify the page. So far Javascript is only used in the login page. The main back-end is built with only Flask

<h4>By the way here's a roadmap. I wanna add all this into this amazing website (I cant even finish the main dashboard)</h4>
<p>❌ means not started. 🚧 means working on it. ✅ means up and running. ⏳ means i give up on this for now</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main dashboard with nice UI  ✅</li>  
  <li>Show basic student info  ✅</li>  
  <li>Show student faculty and subjects info  🚧</li>  
  <li>Show student exam reports  🚧</li>  
  <li>Show student attendence info  ❌</li>  
</ul>
