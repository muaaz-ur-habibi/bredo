        <p>
            I am (was cuz now im in college) a student of Credo School and a self-taught dev. The name is Muaaz Khan and im 16 years old as of 29 June 2024. I really dont know what to write over here, but I guess I could say that this was a very lovely project to work on ü•∞.
            <br><br>My original plan was to also create my own database to store all the info, but then I realised ü§î my site could just be a better front-end implementation of the original school portal. But ofcourse I needed some way to connect that front-end to the original school portal so I used Flask for that.
            <br><br>Honestly the hardest thing about this was probably finding a good free hosting platform since im broke üòì. I spent 3 days finding a good one.
            <br><br>Anyways, I dont think I will really be working on this all that much since this was built as a way for me to pass my time. But if you have any suggestions/improvements, do let me know. And also, if you're reading this, please feel free to share this site with a student of Credo School so that they could benefit from it üòÅ
            <br><br><strong>AND NO I WILL NOT STEAL YOUR ID/PASSWORD BECAUSE I LITERALLY HAVE NO USE FOR it.</strong> Like come on give me one good reason why I would want it?

        <h5><center>How to use?</center></h5>
        <br>
        <p>
            Just use the same <mark>I.D</mark> and <mark>password</mark> that you used for the original school portal and voila!
